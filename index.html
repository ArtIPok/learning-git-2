      <p>So no one told you life was gonna be this way (four claps)<br>
        Your job's a joke, you're broke, your love life's D.O.A.<br>
        It's like you're always stuck in second gear<br>
        When it hasn't been your day, your week, your month, or even your year, but

        But she didn't tell you when the world has brought you down to your knees but

        no one could ever see me<br>
        Seems you're the only one who knows what it's like to be me <br>
        Someone to face the day with, make it through all the rest with <br>
        Someone I'll always laugh with <br>
        Even at my worst, I'm best with you, Yeah! <br>
